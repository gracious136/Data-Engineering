# Data Engineering for Optimal Bike Placement: A Transformative Project**

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a comprehensive data engineering project that redefines bike placement strategies using a symphony of technology, innovation, and collaborative insight. In this project, I explore the intersection of Python, SQL, and AWS to revolutionize how a bike rental company optimizes bike placements at airports.

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **The Challenge:** Bike placement optimization is a multifaceted challenge that requires real-time data integration and intelligent decision-making. I tackled this challenge by orchestrating a dynamic data engineering pipeline that seamlessly combines data from various sources to inform optimal bike placement strategies.

üí° **The Solution:** Leveraging Python's Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries, I extracted city demographics data from Wikipedia and integrated real-time flight information using the AeroDataBox API. These data sources provided valuable insights into passenger traffic and flight schedules, enabling more informed placement decisions.

üå¶Ô∏è **Weather-Driven Insights:** The OpenWeather API further enriched our dataset with real-time weather information. By incorporating weather insights, our bike placement strategies became more contextually aware, accounting for varying weather conditions that could impact bike usage and demand.

‚öôÔ∏è **Automation with AWS:** The heart of this project lies in AWS services. AWS Lambda functions automated data collection and updates, ensuring that our database remained current and relevant. Amazon RDS provided a structured storage solution that facilitated efficient querying and reporting.


üîó **Get Involved:** Dive into this repository to explore the full spectrum of data engineering, from data collection and integration to automated updates and collaborative insights. This project demonstrates the transformative potential of data-driven strategies and technology fusion. Together, let's uncover the future of bike placement optimization!
